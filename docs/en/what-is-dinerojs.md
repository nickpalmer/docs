# What is Dinero.js?

Dinero.js lets you create, calculate and format monetary values in JavaScript.
You can do math, parse and format your objects, ask them questions and **make
your development process easier**.

It provides:

- An immutable and chainable API.
- Global settings support.
- Extended formatting and rounding options.
- Native Intl support (no locale files).
- Currency conversion.

```js
Dinero.defaultCurrency = 'EUR'

Dinero({ amount: 500 })
  .add(Dinero({ amount: 100 }))
  .multiply(4)
  .setLocale('en-GB')
  .toFormat('$0,0.0') // returns "‚Ç¨24.0"
```

**Dinero.js is to money what Moment.js is to dates.**

## Why does Dinero.js exists?

There is much more to money than meets the eye. It‚Äôs way more than the `Number`
data type can take.

### Money is more than a number

The amount part of a monetary value is relative to another aspect: its currency.
There‚Äôs no such thing as 10 ‚Äúmoney‚Äù. It‚Äôs 10 dollars, 10 euros, 10 bitcoins‚Ä¶ To
add two monetary values with different currencies, you need to convert them
first. Same goes for comparing them: if all you have is an amount, you can‚Äôt
make an accurate comparison. **Amount and currency can‚Äôt go without one
another.**

### Floating point math is inacurrate

Some languages have come up with their own solutions like the `BigDecimal` type
in Java or the `decimal` type in C#. JavaScript has the `Number` type, which you
can use as an integer or a [double precision float][wiki:ieee754]. Because this
is a binary representation of a base 10 system, you end up with inaccurate
results when you try to do math.

```js
0.1 + 0.2 // returns 0.30000000000000004 üòß
```

**Using floats to store monetary values is a bad idea.** As you calculate more
values, the imperceptible precision errors lead to larger gaps. This inevitably
ends up causing rounding issues.

### Money needs specific domain logic

Sometimes you need to split money, but **regular math operations like
percentages or division can‚Äôt cut it without adding or losing pennies**.

Imagine you need to bill $999.99 with a 50% downpayment. Half is $499.995, but
you can‚Äôt split a penny so you‚Äôll likely round the result to \$500. Problem is,
as you charge the second half, you end up with the same result and charge a
penny extra.

Instead of relying on basic math to handle money, you need specific techniques
that take the nature of the entity you‚Äôre manipulating into account.

## How does Dinero.js work?

Dinero.js follows [Martin Fowler‚Äôs money pattern and
more][martinfowler:eaa:money]. It‚Äôs immutable and chainable, supports global
settings, has extended formatting options and provides native
internationalization support.

### Why immutable?

An immutable library is safer and more predictable. Mutable operations and
reference copies are a source of bugs. Opting for immutability avoids them
altogether.

**With Dinero.js, you can perform calculations without worrying about altering
original instances.** In the following Vue.js example, calling `priceWithTax`
won‚Äôt alter `price`. If the instance was mutable, it would.

```js
const vm = new Vue({
  data: {
    price: Dinero({ amount: 500 })
  },
  computed: {
    priceWithTax() {
      return this.price.add(this.price.percentage(10))
    }
  }
})
```

### Chainability

Good developers strive to make their code more concise and easier to read. When
you want to successively perform more than one operation on a single object,
chaining provides an elegant notation and concise syntax.

```js
Dinero({ amount: 500 })
  .add(Dinero({ amount: 200 }))
  .multiply(4)
  .setLocale('fr-FR')
  .toFormat() // returns "28,00 US$"
```

### Global settings

When you‚Äôre handling lots of monetary values, chances are you want some of them
to share some attributes. If you‚Äôre making a site in German, you‚Äôll probably
want to show amounts with the German currency format.

This is where global settings come in handy. Instead of passing them to every
instance, you can declare options that apply to all new objects.

```js
Dinero.globalLocale = 'de-DE'
Dinero({ amount: 500 }).toFormat() // returns "5,00 $"
```

### Native Internationalization support

Traditionally, libraries use locale files for internationalization. If you‚Äôre
exhaustive, **they tend to make libraries much heavier**.

Locale files are also hard to maintain. The Internationalization API is native
and [pretty well supported][caniuse:intl]. Unless you have to work with obsolete
browsers, `toFormat` is safe to use.

### Formatting

An object is great to store data, but not so helpful for displaying it.
Dinero.js comes with formatting methods, including `toFormat`. It provides
intuitive and concise syntactic sugar over `Number.prototype.toLocaleString`.
Pair it with `setLocale` to **display any Dinero object into the proper format,
in any language**. This is helpful for multi-lingual use cases such as
international e-commerce sites.

## Why should I use Dinero.js?

Dinero.js is a **modern, reliable, fully tested library that works**. It‚Äôs
lightweight and you can use it in any JavaScript environment.
