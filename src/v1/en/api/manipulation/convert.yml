title: Convert
signature: convert(currency, options)
description: |
  Returns a Promise containing a new Dinero object converted to another currency.

  You have two options to provide the exchange rates:

  1. **Use an exchange rate REST API, and let Dinero handle the fetching and conversion.** This is a simple option if you have access to an exchange rate REST API and want Dinero to do the rest.
  2. **Fetch the exchange rates on your own and provide them directly.** This is useful if you're fetching your rates from somewhere else (a file, a database), use a different protocol or query language than REST (SOAP, GraphQL) or want to fetch rates once and cache them instead of making new requests every time.

  **If you want to use a REST API**, you must provide a third-party endpoint yourself. Dinero doesn't come bundled with an exchange rates endpoint.

  Here are some exchange rate APIs you can use:

  - [Fixer](https://fixer.io)
  - [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org)
  - [Coinbase](https://api.coinbase.com/v2/exchange-rates)
  - More [foreign](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis#currency-exchange) and [crypto](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis#cryptocurrency) exchange rate APIs.

  **If you want to fetch your own rates and provide them directly**, you need to pass a promise that resolves to the exchanges rates.

  In both cases, you need to specify at least:

  - a **destination currency**: the currency in which you want to convert your Dinero object. You can specify it with `currency`.
  - an **endpoint**: the API URL to query exchange rates, with parameters, or a promise that resolves to the exchange rates. You can specify it with `options.endpoint`.
  - a **property path**: the path to access the wanted rate in your API's JSON response (or the custom promise's payload). For example, with a response of:

  ```json
  {
    "data": {
      "base": "USD",
      "destination": "EUR",
      "rate": "0.827728919"
    }
  }
  ```

  Then the property path is `'data.rate'`. You can specify it with `options.propertyPath`.

  The base currency (the one of your Dinero object) and the destination currency can be used as "merge tags" with the mustache syntax, respectively `{{from}}` and `{{to}}`.
  You can use these tags to refer to these values in `options.endpoint` and `options.propertyPath`.

  For example, if you need to specify the base currency as a query parameter, you can do the following:

  ```js
  {
    endpoint: 'https://yourexchangerates.api/latest?base={{from}}'
  }
  ```
examples:
- title: Convert by using global parameters
  code: |
    ```js
    Dinero.globalExchangeRatesApi = { /* ... */ }

    // returns a Promise containing a Dinero object with the destination currency
    // and the initial amount converted to the new currency.
    Dinero({ amount: 500 })
      .convert('EUR')
    ```
- title: Convert by passing local parameters
  code: |
    ```js
    // returns a Promise containing a Dinero object
    Dinero({ amount: 500 })
      .convert('XBT', {
        endpoint: 'https://yourexchangerates.api/latest?base={{from}}',
        propertyPath: 'data.rates.{{to}}',
        headers: {
          'user-key': 'xxxxxxxxx'
        },
        roundingMode: 'HALF_UP'
      })
    ```
- title: Convert with then/catch
  code: |
    ```js
    Dinero({ amount: 500 })
      .convert('EUR')
      .then(dinero => {
        dinero.getCurrency() // returns 'EUR'
      })
      .catch(err => {
        // handle errors
      })
    ```
- title: Convert with async/await
  code: |
    ```js
    (async () => {
      const price = await Dinero({ amount: 500 }).convert('EUR')
      price.getCurrency() // returns 'EUR'
    })()
    ```
- title: Convert with exchange as a custom promise
  code: |
    ```js
    // using the default `propertyPath` format
    // so you don't have to specify it
    const rates = {
      rates: {
        EUR: 0.81162
      }
    }

    Dinero({ amount: 500 })
      .convert('EUR', {
        endpoint: new Promise(resolve => resolve(rates))
      })
    ```
