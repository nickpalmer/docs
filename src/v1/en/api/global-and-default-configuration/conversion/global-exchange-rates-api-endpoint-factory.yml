title: Global endpointFactory
description: |
  Sets the global endpointFactory for exchange rates API for new Dinero objects, which takes from and to currencies and returns a Promise (see [convert](/api/manipulation/convert) for more information). endpointFactory takes precedence over endpoint if both are set.
  **This doesn't affect existing instances.**

      resolve => resolve(globalRates)
    )
